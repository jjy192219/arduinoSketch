WALL_E_BOT:
was a Arduino powered robot I made based on the character “Wall-E” in movie. A ultrasonic distance sensor was constantly measuring the distance of objects in front of it, and two 360 rotating servos were used to control the direction of its movements. Therefore the robot would able to detect the objects in front of it and get around of them.
